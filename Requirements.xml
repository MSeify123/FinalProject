Dear reader,

This Software has been implemented in Udacity workspace/VM. No installation and no downlaods were done.
For the illustration of my changes and code adaptations, please refer to ProjectGuidance.md

Setps
1) Use Jupyter to do the EDA
2) create_splits using the create_splits.py file --> inside comments to declare what has been done
3) Creation of pip_new.config file using edit_config.py
4) Further adaptaion of the config file to get the best loss values
5) Training the model using
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config
6) Evaluation of the model using
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=experiments/reference/
7) Analysis is attached in /home/workspace/AcceptedResultsFinal directory
8) Augmentaion example can be found in /home/workspace/Augmentation directory
9) Exporting the trained model using
python experiments/exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --trained_checkpoint_dir experiments/reference/ --output_directory experiments/reference/exported/
10) Animations are found under /home/workspace, and were created using
python inference_video.py --labelmap_path experiments/reference/label_map.pbtxt --model_path experiments/reference/exported/saved_model --tf_record_path data/test/segment-12200383401366682847_2552_140_2572_140_with_camera_labels.tfrecord --config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --output_path animation1.gif
But were not added to the repo for size matters.

Note:
File tfrecord_template was created to have a look on the structure of the tfrecord.
File getting_images_from_dataset.py was created to download images to be able to analyze the dataset locally in the form of images.
File "script to install chromioum and open jupyter" was created to facilitate opening chromioum and jupyter on the VM.
File ProjectGuidance.md is the writeup file for my project
